# MATLAB Practice Codes

Welcome to my MATLAB Practice Repository! ðŸŽ¯

This repository contains a collection of MATLAB scripts and functions that Iâ€™ve written while learning and practicing various concepts. It serves as a personal reference and a showcase of my progress in mastering MATLAB.

##  Repository Structure

The files in this repo may cover topics including (but not limited to):

- Signal Processing
- Control Systems
- Numerical Methods
- Matrix Operations
- Data Visualization
- File I/O
- Simulink models (if any)

Each script is generally self-contained and includes comments to explain its functionality.

##  Requirements

- [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) (preferably R2021b or later)
- Toolboxes (if used in any specific script) will be mentioned at the top of the file
